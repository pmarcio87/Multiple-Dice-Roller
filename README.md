# Multiple-Dice-Roller

It's necessary to install the numpy package to run the program.

I decided to create this project after failing to find a decent dice roller online for a remote D&D session. Most of the dice rollers that I found
were simple d6 rollers. I tried to create a more complex roller while maintaining the code and the interface simple.
It also allowed me to practice some concepts I've learned, such as generating random numbers.

I'm new to programming, so feedback is much appreciated. All the code has been written by myself from scratch.
